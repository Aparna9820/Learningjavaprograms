//ATM Withdrawal Simulation. (Follow Below Steps to Write Program)
// Steps to Write the Program
// Initialize the account balance with a fixed amount (e.g., â‚¹10,000).
// Take user input for the amount they want to withdraw.
// Check withdrawal conditions:
//The amount should be greater than zero.
//The amount should be a multiple of 100 (common ATM rule).
//The amount should not exceed the account balance.
// Deduct the amount from the balance if conditions are met.
// Display the updated balance or an error message if the withdrawal fails
